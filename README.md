# ComputerArchitectureProject
This project was a fun thing I made for my Computer Architecture class for an explanation on computer
basics.

## The reasons behind it
This is what I chose to do for my midterm. Here is the main prompt I did:
- Identify and describe the basic components of a modern computer system.
Here are the instructions:
- Choose one of the learning objectives listed above
- Research the concepts and topics, and have at least three research citations.
- Create an explanation or tutorial about the topic. 
- Post your first draft here.
- Review at least 2 of your fellow classmates' submissions. Your review response should be approximately 150-200 words for each submission. Use complete, well-written submissions.
